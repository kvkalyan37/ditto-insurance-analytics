COPY main.py .

# Create data directory
RUN mkdir -p /app/data

# Note: Data file (ditto_insurance_data.csv) is NOT copied here
# Reason: The CSV file is generated by the scraper and is large/changes frequently
# 
# Data will be provided via:
# 1. Volume mount in Kubernetes (from PVC)
# 2. Or included during scheduled builds (scheduled-update.yml copies it before build)
# 3. Or the app can work without it initially (will show "no data" until mounted)
#
# This allows the Dockerfile to build successfully even without the data file

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the application
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
